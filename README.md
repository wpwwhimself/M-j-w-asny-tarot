In here you can find all the assets I created in order to design my very own tarot deck.

The origin of this idea was simple â€“ the existing designs weren't very fun for me. I used that to practice my __Adobe Illustrator__ and now you can see that too.

## Folder structure

- `figury`: all the silhouettes for high value cards (P-K),
- `kolory`: symbols for colors,
- `kompletandos`: actual complete cards, merged and colored versions are there too,
- `niemoje`: borrowed assets
